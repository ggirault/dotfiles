  # Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a running
  # ssh-agent(1).  If this option is set to ``yes'' and a key is loaded
  # from a file, the key and its passphrase are added to the agent with
  # the default lifetime, as if by ssh-add(1).  If this option is set
  # to ``ask'', ssh will require confirmation using the SSH_ASKPASS
  # program before adding a key (see ssh-add(1) for details).  If this
  # option is set to ``confirm'', each use of the key must be confirmed,
  # as if the -c option was specified to ssh-add(1).  If this option is
  # set to ``no'', no keys are added to the agent.  The argument must be
  # ``yes'', ``confirm'', ``ask'', or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.
